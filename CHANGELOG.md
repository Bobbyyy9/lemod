## Development History

This mod was restored from a heavily corrupted state where:
- Source files had syntax errors and broken imports
- Multiple conflicting mod classes existed in the same JAR
- Version compatibility was broken across Minecraft/Forge versions
- Author attribution was inconsistent
- Build system was misconfigured

The restoration process involved:
1. **Code Archaeology**: Identifying and fixing corrupted Java files
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Removing duplicate/conflicting mod classes
3. **Version Alignment**: Updating all version dependencies for compatibility
4. **Identity Cleanup**: Consistent author attribution throughout
5. **Modern Tooling**: Updating to current Forge/Gradle standards
6. **Quality Assurance**: Testing across multiple Minecraft versions

**Result**: A clean, modern, fully-functional Minecraft Forge mod ready for development and distribution.
