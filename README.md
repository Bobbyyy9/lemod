```

### Building the Mod

```bash
# Build the mod
./gradlew build

# Clean and build
./gradlew clean build

# Build and copy to mods folder for testing
./gradlew copyJarToMods
```

### Running the Mod

#### 🔧 **Recommended Method: Custom Direct Launcher**
```bash
# Use our custom script that bypasses module system issues
./run-minecraft-direct.ps1
```

Or via VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "prepareForTesting"

This script will:
1. Build the mod automatically
2. Copy the JAR to the mods folder  
3. Open the build folder for easy access
4. Provide the JAR path for external testing

#### Option 1: Manual Testing (Always Works)
1. Build the mod: `./gradlew build`
2. Locate the JAR: `build/libs/lemod-1.21.1-1.0.0.jar`
3. Install Minecraft Forge 1.21.1 separately
4. Copy the JAR to your Minecraft `mods` folder
5. Launch Minecraft normally

#### Option 2: Using Gradle Tasks (Module System Issues)
```bash
# These currently fail due to module system issues but mod itself is fine
./gradlew runClient  # ❌ Module jopt.simple not found  
./gradlew runServer  # ❌ Same issue
```

#### Option 3: Using VS Code (Module System Issues)
- Press `F5` to start debugging ❌
- Or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "runClient" ❌

### Adding New Content

#### Adding Items:
1. Open `src/main/java/com/uipg/lemod/init/ModItems.java`
2. Uncomment the example items or add new ones
3. Add translations in `src/main/resources/assets/lemod/lang/en_us.json`
4. Add to creative tab in `ModCreativeModeTabs.java`

#### Adding Blocks:
1. Open `src/main/java/com/uipg/lemod/init/ModBlocks.java`
2. Add your block registration
3. Create corresponding item in `ModItems.java` if needed
4. Add translations and textures

### Gradle Properties

The mod uses properties from `gradle.properties`:
- `mod_version`: Version of your mod
- `mod_group_id`: Your mod's group ID
- `mod_id`: Your mod's ID (must match the @Mod annotation)
- `minecraft_version`: Target Minecraft version
- `forge_version`: Target Forge version

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Build Errors
If you encounter build errors, try these steps:

1. **Clean and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
   ```

2. **Check Java version**: Ensure you're using Java 21
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

3. **Refresh Gradle**: In VS Code, open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run "Java: Refresh Projects"

#### Fixed Issues (Historical Reference)
- **Corrupted ModItems.java**: Fixed broken comment syntax that prevented compilation
- **Component API Issues**: Updated imports and API calls for Minecraft 1.21.1 compatibility
- **Build Configuration**: Ensured proper ForgeGradle and toolchain configuration

#### Minecraft Launch Issues
- **Current Known Issue**: Java 21 module system conflict with `jopt.simple` dependency
- **Error**: `Module jopt.simple not found, required by cpw.mods.modlauncher`
- **Workaround**: Copy `build/libs/lemod-1.21.1-1.0.0.jar` to external Minecraft Forge 1.21.1 installation
- **Alternative**: Use different Java version or external Minecraft launcher
- Ensure the mod JAR is built: `./gradlew build`
- Check that Java 21 is being used
- Verify Forge version compatibility in `gradle.properties`

#### VS Code Integration Issues
- Install recommended Java extensions
- Restart VS Code after initial project load
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Java: Refresh Projects" if IntelliSense isn't working
